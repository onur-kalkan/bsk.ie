This is a simple link shortener project for Bluesky usernames.
It's a simple 404.html file redirects "../whatever" part in the url (ex. bsk.ie/username) to related Bluesky profile; https://bsky.app/profile/username.bsky.social on the date of this document created.

Note: To use it with your own host just change relevant html file to 404.shtml and add "ErrorDocument 404 /404.shtml" to .htaccess file in your server.
